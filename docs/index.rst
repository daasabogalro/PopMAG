Welcome to PopMAG's documentation!
===================================

**PopMAG** is a bioinformatics pipeline that integrates genome-resolved metagenomics with populations genomics workflows. 
The pipeline takes a MAGs samplesheet, a reads files samplesheet and a metadata file as input, and is divided in three main sections:

    MAG Quality control
    Abundance calculation and Variant Calling
    Population genomics metrics and Visualization
