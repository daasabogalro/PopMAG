PopMAG
===================================

**PopMAG** is a pipeline that integrates genome-resolved metagenomics with population genomics tools to analyze metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and their population-level variations. 
The pipeline processes MAGs alongside paired-end sequencing short reads (or BAM files) to perform quality assessment, abundance profiling, variant calling, and population genomics analyses, ending in an interactive visualization dashboard built with shiny.

The pipeline is organized into five main phases: 

* MAG Quality control and preprocessing
* Microbial community profiling
* Abundance calculation and variant calling
* Population genomics and functional analysis
* Visualization and reporting

PopMAG can aid to understand both the functional potential and population dynamics of metagenome-assembled genomes, particularly in the context of comparative genomics and temporal or spatial studies.
